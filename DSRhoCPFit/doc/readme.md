DSRhoCPFit
========
This program performs a CP violation fit of the B<sup>0</sup> -> (D<sup>\*</sup> -> D<sup>0</sup>π)(ρ -> ππ<sup>0</sup>). It is a time-dependent angular fit including detector efficiency. The resulting parameters are transversity amplitudes and rhos in Cartesian coordinates.

More information about the involved physics can be found in Belle Note 419 and <a href="http://www-ucjf.troja.mff.cuni.cz/~cervenkov/diploma_thesis/dip_thesis.pdf">My Diploma Thesis</a>.

The program itself contains a help page explaining its usage. Just add a `-h` or `--help` argument.

_Note_

These pages, whilst readable by themselves, are designed to be run through the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.com) code documentation engine which builds an entire local cross-referenced set of docs. It uses a minor [extension of Markdown formatting.](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html)

The settings to generate the documentation are in `DSRhoCPFit.doxy`.
